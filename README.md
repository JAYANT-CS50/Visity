# Visity
Thank you, Visity, for providing me with the opportunity to showcase my web development skills using React.js for the front-end and Django for the back-end. Throughout this project, I was able to demonstrate my proficiency in these technologies and implement various features.

- Developed a user data form using React.js components, including Formik and Yup for form validation.
- Implemented functionality to submit form data to the Django back-end using the Fetch API and JSON payload.
- Fetched and displayed existing data from the Django API endpoint using the useEffect hook in React.js.
- Designed a table to showcase submitted and retrieved data, using the map function to render table rows.
- Implemented delete functionality by sending a DELETE request to the Django API endpoint and updating the front-end state.
- Introduced editing functionality with the editingId state variable and conditional rendering of an EditForm component.
- Updated data through a PUT request to the Django API endpoint and reflected changes in the front-end state.
- Demonstrated proficiency in React.js and Django, showcasing web development skills.

Overall, this project served as an excellent opportunity for me to demonstrate my proficiency in web development using React.js and Django. I appreciate Visity for providing me with this platform to showcase my skills and contribute to this exciting project.
