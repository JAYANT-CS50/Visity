#### Description:

I would like to express my gratitude to CS50 for providing me with the opportunity to showcase my web development skills. In this project, I had the chance to demonstrate my proficiency in using React.js for the front-end and Django for the back-end. Throughout the development process, I implemented various features and utilized these technologies to their full potential.

#### User Data Form
One of the key aspects of the project was the development of a user data form using React.js components. I leveraged popular libraries such as Formik and Yup for efficient form validation. These tools allowed me to create a user-friendly form interface while ensuring that the submitted data met the required criteria.

#### Integration with Django Back-end
To establish a seamless connection between the front-end and the back-end, I implemented functionality to submit the form data to the Django back-end. Using the Fetch API, I constructed HTTP requests with JSON payloads, ensuring that the user data was transmitted accurately and securely. This integration allowed for efficient communication between the React.js components and the Django framework.

#### Displaying Data from Django API
In addition to submitting form data, I also implemented the ability to fetch and display existing data from a Django API endpoint. Leveraging the power of the useEffect hook in React.js, I efficiently retrieved data from the Django API and updated the user interface accordingly. This feature enhanced the user experience by presenting relevant information dynamically.

#### Table Design and Data Rendering
To present the submitted and retrieved data in an organized manner, I designed a table component. Utilizing the map function in React.js, I dynamically rendered table rows based on the data received from the Django API. This approach provided a structured and visually appealing display of the user data, making it easier for users to navigate and comprehend the information.

#### Delete and Edit Functionality
I further enhanced the project by implementing delete and edit functionality. For deletion, I integrated a mechanism to send DELETE requests to the Django API endpoint, allowing users to remove specific entries from the database. Moreover, I introduced editing functionality by managing an editingId state variable. This allowed for conditional rendering of an EditForm component, enabling users to update existing data through a PUT request to the Django API.

#### Proficiency in React.js and Django
This project served as a testament to my proficiency in both React.js and Django. By successfully implementing various features and showcasing my web development skills, I demonstrated a deep understanding of these technologies. The project highlighted my ability to leverage the strengths of React.js for interactive user interfaces and Django for robust back-end functionality.

Overall, I am grateful to CS50 for providing me with this platform to showcase my skills and contribute to an exciting web development project. Through the integration of React.js and Django, I was able to create a seamless and powerful application that meets the requirements of modern web development.
